      1. Commit time
      * I plan to work at least 25 hours/week on the program
	2. Avoid lulls
		* I plan to work 5-6 days/week
	3. Good use of mentor
		* I plan to prep for meetings with relevant questions & topics
	4. Roller coaster
		* I’m great with the **ups** but not so good when it comes to bottoming-out during the **downs**, so I’ll have to work on perseverance through those periods.
	5. Foraging
		* I have lots of experience with foraging, as research was a key element of my previous career in prospect development, and I would usually have to figure out answers and data how-to’s on my own.
